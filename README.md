Repository for Group 11- Project #1 GSS

Our final paper was formatted into a Google Docs file, which can be found at the following link, as well as in the repository as a pdf: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1es-14d3hzx4Ot4Dfl-AKuU2hp56jRD6Va_4Ebp8nAm4/edit?usp=sharing

Other edited files in the repo include our modified get_gss.ipynb, which we used to pull the data for our research from the Codebook, and the new file 'cleaning_data.ipnyb' where we cleaned the data, as referenced in our paper.
